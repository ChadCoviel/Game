HW #1 Comp Sci 308

I plan to code a simple side scrolling 2D platforming game. I want the player to be able to jump, run, collect items, 
attack enemies, and have a good time. The game will have multiple levels. The levels become more difficult as the player
progresses. The game is called: Reclaim. The purpose of the game is to attain lost memory experiences and to do so the 
player much traverse a series of physical obstacles and enemies in the journey to Reclaim full knowledge of oneself. 

Controls:
left d-pad arrow = move left on screen
right d-pad arrow = move right on screen
down d-pad arrow = crouch
up d-pad arrow = look up
